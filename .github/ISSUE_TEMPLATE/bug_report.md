**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. On Linux you can try running Superpaper in terminal with the debugging flag `-d` to see if it spits out an error, post that if it does. On Windows you can enable logging to file in the settings.

If your issue is with wallpaper spanning, check first that the OS background fitting style is set to 'span' (doesn't apply to KDE & XFCE).

1. Go to '...'

3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error
